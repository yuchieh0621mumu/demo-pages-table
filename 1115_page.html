    <h1 class="title">Welcome to the Mini-Project-3 table of HTML</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
      The goal of this task is to organize web resources by documenting each link's character encoding type and HTTP status code in a table.
First, we have to assemble a comprehensive list of URLs to be analyzed. and then I write a bash script to access each URL and record the HTTP status code. The HTTP status will indicate the response from the server, such as 200 OK for successful responses, 404 Not Found for broken links, etc.After that, I identify the character encoding for each web page. This information is typically found in the page's headers or meta tags as Content-Type, for example, text/html; charset=UTF-8.
After I finish collecting all the essential information of these linksn I tried to make a table with three columns:URL, HTTP Status, and Encoding, and fill in this table with the data collected from steps 2 and 3 for each link.
and here is a detailed table that lists each URL with its corresponding HTTP status code and character encoding.
